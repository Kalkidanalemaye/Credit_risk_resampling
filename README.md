# Credit_risk_resampling

## Objective

#### To build and evaluate several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from LendingClub; a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## The goal of the challenge
1. Implement machine learning models.
2. Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
3. Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

## Intructions

1. Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
2. Undersample the data using the cluster centroids algorithm.
3. Use a combination approach with the SMOTEENN algorithm.

#### Each step above requires to train a logistic regression classifier (from Scikit-learn) using the resampled data, calculate the balanced accuracy score using balanced_accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics, generate a confusion_matrix and print the classification report (classification_report_imbalanced from imblearn.metrics).
